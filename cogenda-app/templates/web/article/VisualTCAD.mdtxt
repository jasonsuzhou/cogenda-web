-----------
##### [Product Brochure](/downloads/VisualTCAD.pdf) | [Video Demo](./Tutorial-VisualTCAD1:wide)

VisualTCAD is the latest graphical user interface for the Genius device simulator. VisualTCAD is designed to suit novice TCAD users and students, and focuses on ease of use. Using TCAD has never been as easy, no more command line or coding is required. Beginners will be able to get started within just a few minutes. On the other hand, it doesn't sacrifice the power of Genius. All the physical models and options are accessible with VisualTCAD.

VisualTCAD is capable of device simulation of 2D and 3D, SPICE circuit simulation and mixed device/circuit simulation. It consists of the following modules

 * Device structure drawing tool
 * Circuit schematic capturing tool
 * GUI simulation controller
 * Visualization tool of simulation results
 * Spreadsheet
 * X-Y plotting tool

There is a [10-minute video demonstration](./Tutorial-VisualTCAD1:wide) showing the functionalities of VisualTCAD. Trial versions of VisualTCAD can be downloaded [here](./download). Some screenshots are shown below.
