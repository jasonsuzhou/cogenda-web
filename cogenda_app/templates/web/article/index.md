Genius Device Simulator
-----------
##### [{{_('Get more information')}}](/article/products#Genius)

If your TCAD simulations are taking too long and you wish to improve your productivity, there is finally an option in the market. We are proud to present Genius, the next-generation 3D parallel device simulator. Genius provides unprecedented capability and performance with leading parallel computing technologies. Genius is the first commercial TCAD device simulator that scales beyond the [10-transistor barrier](./TenTransistor). With Genius, one is able to routinely simulate circuit cells like inverter, 6T SRAM, latch and flip-flop, and expect 10 fold reduction in simulation run times.

Unlike many TCAD products in the market, the Genius Device Simulator is a completely new design. Parallelism, scalability and extensibility were considered in its design goals at a very early stage. Furthermore, Genius has been constructed using the atest numerical simulation techniques and software development tools.

Gds2Mesh is a 3D TCAD model contruction tool. It takes GDSII mask layout as input, and construct the device model with predefined and customizable process rules.

The geometric engine is capable of re-creating slanted STI side-walls, rounded STI corners, bird's beak and other details.
Mesh is generated automatically, and mesh in the channel and junction regions are refined for accurate simulation.
The generated device structure can be imported in Genius for device simulation.

VisualFab Workbench for Process Experiments
-----------
##### [{{_('Get more information')}}](/article/products#VFab)

VisualFab is an integrated workbench for process simulation experiments. It adopts the concepts familiar to fab engineers, e.g. process module, split, wafer and split table.
It also allows user to visualize these concepts and design experiments in a user-friendly GUI.
